The [Viper verification infrastructure](http://viper.ethz.ch), developed at ETH
Zurich, comprises an expressive intermediate verification language (also called
Viper) and several back-end tools such as automated verifiers.
Viper aims at reducing the effort involved with developing new
automated verification tools for permission-based reasoning.
